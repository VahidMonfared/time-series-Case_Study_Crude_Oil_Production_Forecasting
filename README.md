📘 Project Title:
Crude Oil Production Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis
📝 Project Instruction (Brief):
This project aims to analyze historical crude oil production data using time series techniques to forecast future output. The notebook will walk through loading and visualizing the data, performing stationarity checks, selecting and training time series models (such as ARIMA or SARIMA), and generating accurate forecasts for upcoming periods. The results will help uncover production trends and support decision-making in the energy sector.
